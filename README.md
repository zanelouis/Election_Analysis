1. A python file named PyPoll.py is created to pull the data from one source.
2. The results are coded in to write the results specified into a new file named election_analysis.txt.
3. The files are pushed and committed to our repository with comments added along the way
4. The Readme.md in the repository shared is updated with an overview summary.

## Challenge Summary
We can provide the Colorado Board of Elections employee with the recent local congressional election by using PyPoll.py to pulling, analyzing and summarizing the data into a text file.
